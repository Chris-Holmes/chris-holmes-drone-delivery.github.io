The App integrates into existing e-commerce sites in a similar fashion to 3rd party payment providers such as PayPal or Afterpay. Once the user has set up their delivery and paid for their product they are then onboarded onto our App for tracking and receiving their delivery. Flybuys provides a flexible, convenient, and secure service that apartment residents desire!</p>

These deliveries would be accessible after business hours and would arrive within short windows of time to provide a service that is convenient and reliable.</p>

            <p class="d-flex justify-content-center fly-body">After choosing our concept we began exploring the information that users would need at each stage of the jounrey. We realised that the delivery experience was quite linear and could fall into 4 different stages. We used card sorting to map out the information architecture and how it would fit with these 4 stages.</p>

                    <p class="d-flex justify-content-center fly-body">We decided to start thinking through the more complex and unique functions that our App would undergo. A lot of these functions weren't unique in and of themselves but were made more complex due to the autonomous nature of our drone delivery technology that we were designing for. For example the traditional delivery experience only requires users share a residential or postal address. Autonomous drones offered exciting new possibilities such as getting a delivery to your balcony or somewhere else in your apartment complex. So this required new design patterns.</p>

            <p class="d-flex justify-content-center fly-body">Our goal for our first round of user testing was to explore which user flow provided a more intuitive user experience. Our user flows differed in the sense that they placed the requirement for the user to enter the exact delivery location at different stages. Flow 1 placed this event before the commencement of payment i.e. while the user was still on an ecommerce platform and ordering their product. Flow 2 on the other hand envisioned that this would take place later once the parcel had been ordered and as the user was setting up the drone delivery app.</p>

                    <p class="d-flex justify-content-center fly-body">We set the users a number of taks to perform with the paper prototypes in order to simulate the functionality of the app. These had been put on the Marvel app in order to provide the realism of using a smart phone. One set of our users tested Flow 1 first and then performed the same set of taks with Flow 2. The second lot of users started with Flow 2 and then went on to use Flow 1. As they were performing these tasks we encouraged them to use the Think Aloud protocol and verbalise their thoughts, feelings and frustrations. On top of this we observed how well they were completing these tasks and whether they had any difficulties or if their actions were contradicting their verbalised thoughts. Once they had completed the tasks we asked a few semi-structured interview questions aimed at getting the user to reflect on their experience.</p>

            <p class="d-flex justify-content-center fly-body">After receiving feedback from our first round of user testing we iterated on our paper prototypes to make imporvements based upon the results we discovered. At this stage we chose to increase the fidelity of our prototype and created digital wireframes using Sketch. These were then added to Invision so we could create clickable hotspot links and connect all the screens. This was done so that we would have a more realistic prototype that we could completely click through for our next stage of user testing.</p>

            <p class="d-flex justify-content-center fly-body">At this stage we wanted to focus more specifically on the usability and intuitive nature of each screen and the UI elements and patterns that the user encountered. For example in the first test we were more concerned with the big picture, the overall user flow and when we should get the user to select the delivery location. Here we wanted to focus on their experience of actually selecting the delivery location for example and make sure this experience was coherent and simple.</p>

                    <p class="d-flex justify-content-center fly-body">We had the user complete a lot of smaller tasks i.e. ‘choose the delivery time, choose the delivery location’ and then asked them questions straight after they had completed each task. In total we broke the App into 20 different stages and asked a set of questions at each of these stages, so it was quite an in-depth process. These questions were particularly aimed at gauging their thoughts, what they liked, disliked and any concerns they had about each screen and the functions that they performed. We took notes at every point that we asked questions. After we had done this for every stage of the App we asked some brief reflection questions aimed at getting them to reflect on their entire experience and the overall flow of the App.</p>
