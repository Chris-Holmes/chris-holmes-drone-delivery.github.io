                <h6>Interviews - Semistructured</h6>
                <p>HOW // 7 participants were chosen that represent a broad age demographic (19-61) and who have experience with different types of Apartment deliveries (small parcels, food, larger goods).</p>
                <p>WHY // Important to gain insight into the perspective and attitudes of a variety of different users. Paying particular attention to their experiences, needs, pain points and poignant emotions as this is important to understand what they find frustrating and what they appreciate.</p>
                <p>HOW IT WILL BE ANALYSED // The data was recorded and transcribed. From this it was analysed by the creation of an Affinity Diagram. This enabled the similar needs, frustration, and appreciations to be grouped and collated.</p>
                  
                <h6>Direct Experience Storyboarding</h6>
                <p>HOW // An actual delivery was carried out. Some small goods were ordered to an apartment online and the process was recorded and documented.</p>
                <p>WHY // Great for the designer to immerse themselves and understand the user’s experience firsthand. This enabled me to appreciate the users current experience of deliveries and what I found frustrating and what I appreciated.</p>
                <p>HOW IT WILL BE ANALYSED // The data will be recorded via photos and notes which will be presented in a storyboard. A reflection on this experience will be offered with my key frustrations of the process listed and my key appreciations of the existing service.</p>

                <h5>BIO</h5>
                <p>Jane, 25, lives in an aprtment in the Hills district yet travels to the city everday for work. Here she works in marketing at an agency. She is passionate about photography, fashion and brunch. Naturally she spends too much of her downtime shopping for clothes and makeup online. When ordering online she often doesn’t have much control over her delivery options and finds that the companies she buys products from normally outsource this processs to another company such as Australia Post or StarTrack. She often comes home to find that she has missed a delivery and as her apartment has nowhere safe to store them, they end up getting sent to the local post office. She is always annoyed that by the time she gets home, the Post office is always closed and her only window to pick them up is Saturday morning. She has had to cancel brunch a coupel times to pick up her orders and this always makes her incredibly annoyed. She wishes there was a way for deliveries to be more flexible and arrive after work hours so she didn’t have to drive to the post office every time she got something delivered.</p>

                <h5>BIO</h5>
                <p>Bradley, 34, works in a demanding industry as a Pharmaceutical Rep. This means he often finds himself travelling and working late hours which is a struggle for his young family. Sometimes when he comes home late from work and finds his wife and 2 year old daughter asleep he realises he hasn’t had dinner and orders food from a nearby restaurant using the Uber Eats App. While he waits for his food to arrive he often finds himself catching up on some work or putting on the dishwasher so he doesn’t get in trouble the next morning. However whilst he is trying to catch up on these things he often notices that he is interupted by the delivery driver calling him when he can’t find his apartment in the complex. Furthermore often he has to go down the elevator to pick up the food as he doesn’t want to have to give the delivery guy his lift code for safety reasons. He wishes there was a way his food could just apear at his door and that getting food delievered would be a more hassle free experience so he could use the waiting time more productively.</p>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <h4>My Idea - Idea One</h4>
                <p>I envisioned a drone service in which people were able to have a drone deliver their package straight to their apartment balcony. After chatting to apartment residents I was aware that some apartments did not have balconies and that there would need to be other locations at the apartment complex that could also function as delivery points.</p>
                <p>To explore this option more I storyboarded the idea to gauge what sort of interactions would need to occur.</p>
                <img src="img/process-journal/storyboard3.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4" alt="Responsive image">
                <p>After completing the first storyboard I realised that there could be an issue if the user had ordered the drone to arrive at a particular time and then forgotten about the order and would not be home when it arrived. I storyboarded this scenario to plan out how I thought the service could deal with this issue.</p>
                <img src="img/process-journal/storyboard4.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4" alt="Responsive image">
                <p>Having storyboarded the idea and thought through it from different avenues I felt I was ready to evaluate it. I did so by comparing it to the Problem statement and key user needs that we had developed.</p>
                <h6>Pros:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>This delivery method gives the user flexible options to fit around their schedueles. The drone can basically arrive whenever in a short window of time (~15-30min feels adequate).</li>
                    <li>It delivers directly to the apartment and saves the user having to go to the post office if they miss it.</li>
                    <li>It provides a clear, real-time way to track your delivery. Possibly even have option to see live camera feed from drone?? The fact that the delivery timeslot is so short also lessons the need to excessively track your order (as you don’t need to plan around it as much)</li>
                    <li>It delivers directly to the apartment and saves the user having to go to the post office if they miss it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Cons:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potentially an issue with cross platform performance i.e. what if the user does online shopping on their laptop and hence sets up the drone delivery via their laptop. Will they also need the Phone App in order to pick up their order once it has arrived on the drone? How will you make this clear or enforce people to download the App in order to complete the transaction?</li>
                    <li>What happens if they miss the drone? Is this possible, what would this look like? Refer to consideration re how long the drone would wait for the user to respond.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Considerations:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>What happens if you book a timeslot and then realise you cannot make it anymore? Can you rescheduele the drone delivery time? Is this for free or will it cost money? Can you get it to drop off the parcel in a safe location if you desire?</li>
                    <li>How does choosing the location of the delivery work?? It is no longer about choosing general address but about an exact location</li>
                    <li>How does the drone notify the user when it arrives? Does it leave a message, does it more or less call the users phone?</li>

                    <li>How does the user receive the parcel once the drone has arrived? Does it land and dispense the parcel? Does the user pick it up while the drone is still flying? Do they need to scan something to verify they have received the parcel? Can the drone photograph/video this interaction for proof?</li>

                <h4>Idea Two</h4>
                <p>This concept was developed by a group member. It envisions that apartments now have a delivery bay that drones can delivery parcels to. Once the parcel has been dropped off it is stored in a central location at the apartment and accessed via a kiosk. A user would be notified and pick up there parcel at any time from the kiosk after it has arrived.</p>

A drone is able to fly to the appropraite chute and drop the parcel off which is accessed on the inside by those living in the apartment.</p>

                <h4>Ideation Evaluation</h4>
                <p>My thoughts: We had developed our 3 ideas separately and then came together to pitch them to one another and critique each others idea. From there we went away and thought more before deciding which one we should choose to focus and iterate upon. I was a little apprehensive that the decision making process could get messy and that we would need to create a complex set of metrics in order to validate them</p>
               <p>We all realised quite quickly that our ideas fit into two different categories. My idea (idea one) assumed that drone delivery technology would be operating with apartment infrastructure as we currently know it. The other two ideas assumed that apartments would change and look drastically different with the introduction of autonomous drone technology. In light of this we were aware that the second category had an increasingly high amount of hypothetical variables. For example would all

                <h4>Finding the 'Right Look'</h4>
                <p>In order to find the right aesthetic for our app we began looking for inspiration by looking on Dribbble which is a platform where designers share their work.</p>
                <p>Originally I was planning on creating a proper moodboard but due to time contrainsts (we had 2 weeks to develop high fidelity mockups and an interactive prototype and companion product website) I created a Bucket on Dribbble. A bucket is basically just a repository of the images and gifs you have liked.</p>
